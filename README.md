#Slidify Presentation: Shiny Stock App

I added this readme file because seems to be that there is some issue in the github servers.
You can download the files from the repository by clicking the button Download ZIP at right bottom corner.
Once you extract the content of the .zip file in your local machine you can double click the index.html file 
or you can just  do ¨Open with¨  and select your favorite browser.
It has been tested for Firefox, Chrome and IE, but some error occurs when uploading the files to Github.
I receive an email with the following information.

¨The page build failed with the following error:

The file `index.md` contains markdown errors. For more information, see https://help.github.com/articles/page-build-failed-markdown-errors.

If you have any questions please contact us at https://github.com/contact.¨

That's why I do not send the direct link to the webpage but the link to the repo. 
But, as you can see, there are not markdown errors because you will be able to see the presentation locally including the 
embedded R code that runs when slidifying the document showing a pretty chart.

**Note: Finally I proceeded to delete the index.md file and now we can see the presentation online at http://ddrbcn.github.io.**
**Note: I have detected some problems using Firefox. Sometimes the chart is not showed.**
